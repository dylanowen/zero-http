# zero-http

This is a replacement for `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or `python -m http.server`.

## Why
It explicitly makes sure not to cache any results and probably some other things eventually

## Config
It reads a `.zero-http` folder either from the working directory or `~/.zero-http` see the folder in the repo for a sample config.
